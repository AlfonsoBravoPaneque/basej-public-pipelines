# Shared QC scoring for the basej-* QC composition plots.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Every QC composition script used to score cells by COUNTING how many fixed thresholds a
# cell passed (`Mat` + `rowSums`). That has two defects:
#
#   * failures are interchangeable - missing PreSeq by 5% costs the same one point as CNV
#     MAPD being 3x over threshold, so the resulting 1-5 number is not an ordering;
#   * the count is displayed as an ordered tier, so a cell that fails a gate outright still
#     renders in the second band. On real data 53 of 84 cells scoring 4 of 5 were failing
#     PreSeq, including 7 cells with PreSeq of exactly zero.
#
# Here a tier requires EVERY one of its conditions to hold (conjunctive AND), so a cell can
# never rank above its weakest metric. Tier specs are nested by construction - tier 5's
# thresholds are tighter than tier 4's on the same metrics - so the ordering is meaningful.
#
# Tier 4 is deliberately set to each assay's established gate values, so `tier >= 4` stays
# identical to the old "all gates pass" (CompositeScore == 5) and published counts reconcile.
#
# DISPLAY BANDS
#   5, 4 -> Pass        4 = meets the established gates, 5 = tighter still
#   3    -> Borderline  relaxed thresholds; usable if capacity allows
#   2, 1 -> Fail        2 = too little data to judge, 1 = fails outright
#
# Used by dna_qc_plot.R, methyl_qc_plot.R, rna_qc_plot.R, wgs_qc_plot.R, wes_qc_plot.R
# and basej-hifiqc/bin/hifiqc_composition_plot.R.

#' Depth floor below which a cell's metrics cannot be trusted.
#'
#' Coverage-derived metrics degrade with sequencing depth, not just cell quality: on the
#' validation cohort the PreSeq pass rate ran 0% / 41% / 87% / 98% / 97% across the
#' <0.3M / 0.3-0.6M / 0.6-1.0M / 1.0-1.5M / >1.5M read bands. A cell judged below that is
#' being scored on its depth. Such cells become tier 2 (Inconclusive) - unknown, not bad.
#'
#' Two modes:
#'   absolute   - `min_value`, when the assay has an established number (Illumina low-pass DNA)
#'   relative   - `median_frac` x the run median, when it does not (HiFi, RNA)
#'
#' The relative mode is deliberately median-relative rather than a fixed bottom percentile: a
#' percentile condemns a constant fraction of cells even when the whole run is uniformly good.
#'
#' @return logical vector, TRUE where the cell is below the floor

#' Apply a tier spec's condition for one column.
#'
#' gt/lt are strict, ge/le inclusive. Both forms exist because the original scripts were not
#' consistent - the DNA gates were written `>` while the WGS/WES read and coverage gates were
#' written `>=`. For an integer metric such as total_reads the boundary is reachable, so
#' collapsing the two would silently move cells sitting exactly on a gate.
#'
#' A condition may carry more than one comparison, all of which must hold, which is how a
#' two-sided band is written: `c(gt = 40, lt = 90)` for "between 40 and 90". Methylation needs
#' this - too little AND too much conversion both indicate a failed library - and expressing it
#' as a range beats the alternative of duplicating the column under a second name.
